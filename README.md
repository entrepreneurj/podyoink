podyoink.py

This script ensures you don't miss an episode of a podcast by downloading and storing them for
you for consumption later.  Run it as a suitably-frequent cron job on an always-connected server/box
and you'll have a directory full of episodes when you want them.

Edit the variables at the start of the script to configure it.

See LICENSE for a copy of the MIT License this is under.  Feel free to use/improve as you see fit.
Patches welcome, although I'd rather you forked if you want to completely change the purpose of this
code - ie. not something to run on a cronjob and forget about any more.
